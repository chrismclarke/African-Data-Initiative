    15 July 2017 <br />
  </p>
  <p>
In our last update, we told you the exciting news that we’ll be launching R-Instat and the African Data Initiative project at the upcoming<a href="http://payment.isi2017.org/">World Statistics Congress</a>. This will take place in Marrakech, Morocco in the week of 16 July. That’s just less than a month for our team to prepare presentations, talks, posters, and of course R-Instat itself!
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparation for this, we have just released our third major beta version: R-Instat 0.3. For those of you who signed up as beta testers in the original campaign, it would be great if you could try out this version and give us your feedback. And of course, anyone else interested in trying out the software is welcome to download it and let us know what you think. <br />
  Instructions on downloading and testing R-Instat can be found at <a href="http://www.africanmathsinitiative.net/blog/initiatives/african-data-initiative/">AMI Website</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The next time you hear from us will probably be from Morocco where we can update you about the launch of the project you helped to created almost two years ago now. <br />
    Thanks again for your all your contributions and continued support on our journey to improve statistics for everyone.

    A lot has been happening with the African Data Initiative since we released the first beta version of R-Instat. Our first full version is coming soon and beta versions are already being used to improve statistics teaching and research in Africa, and beyond! We're officially launching R-Instat at the World Statistics Congress in Morocco in July after our proposal for a special topic session on the African Data Initiative project was accepted, which we hope can kick start the next phase of ADI. <br />
    As always, none of this would have been possible without all of our fantastic supporters so we want to once again thank you for all your contributions and continued support on our journey to improve statistics for everyone.

    R-Instat already creating impact!<br />
  </p>
  <p>
  James Musyoka (star of our campaign video) is using R-Instat this semester at Maseno University, Kenya to teach an innovative statistics course to his undergraduate students. Not only is he making use of R-Instat to give his students practical experience using data, but he's also using e-learning resources, developed by one of our partners, and now adapted for R-Instat, to provide his students access to high quality digital notes, examples and exercise. We look forward to sharing the feedback from James and his students with you at the end of the course.

    Workshop at AIMS Tanzania links statistics to public procurement<br />
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="assets\images\workshop.jpg"/> <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We continue to work with our partners in<a href="http://www.aims.ac.tz/">AIMS Tanzania</a> , and in March we held a workshop for their Masters students titled Data Driven Approach to Measuring Corruption Risks. Students learnt about the ways in which data are being used to measure and monitor corruption risks in public procurement and they got to use R-Instat's new facilities to analyse real procurement data from the World Bank. You can read more about this in an <a href="https://scscsussex.wordpress.com/2017/05/26/data-software-and-talent-turning-open-data-into-a-useful-anti-corruption-tool-for-africa/">article by corruption expert Liz David-Barrett</a>.

  More groups benefiting from R-Instat!<br />
  </p>
  <p>
  The creator of the corruption risks measurements, Mihaly Fazekas, is using R-Instat in his teaching on an international Masters program in Public Procurement Management at the University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. We're really pleased about this because it shows we are already fulfilling our ambitious of spreading R-Instat outside of Africa!
  <br />
  Our partner,<a href="https://stats4sd.org/">Statistics for Sustainable Development</a> Statistics for Sustainable Development, are using R-Instat in some of their projects, including to support agricultural researchers in West Africa who need to manipulate and analyse data from their surveys. This is an exciting step forward as these researchers are one of our original target audiences from our campaign.
